                                    /!\   BEFORE STARTING THE PROJECT, YOU MUST HAVE THE .ENV file for the backend environment.

First of all, make sure to add the ".env" file that has been sent to you in the backend folder.

In the src folder, please run " npm start ", if you got any message's issues, please refer to the "if you got issues starting the frontend, add those commands"
In the backend folder, please run " nodemon server ", if you have an error saying that the policy on your computer doesn't allow script please run " npm run start " instead.

If you have any trouble running the project, please make sure to contact me on Openclassrooms. Thanks!
